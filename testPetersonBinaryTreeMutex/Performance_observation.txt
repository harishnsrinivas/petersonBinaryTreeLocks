1. The binary tree lock implementation performs poorly when the number of thereads are increased in the powers of 2. 

2. Because a thead acquires all the locks from its leaf to the root, it blocks all other threads from advancing to higher level locks.

3. The spin wait times are higher and proportional to the time spent by a thread in the critical section.



Note: I apologize for not being to generate graphs. I had issues ploting it via tool.
